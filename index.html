<p>Many moons ago, a little device called the iPod Nano was taking the world of technology by storm: simply shake, it was advertised, to start the next song. Since then, shake-to-shuffle has become a mainstay of Apple products, yet this seemingly trivial feature has the potential for so much more—it's 2013, after all. What if you could apply it to the Android world? What if you could refine vigorous shaking into graceful tilting? What if you could control more than just the "Next Song" button? These might have been rhetorical questions—but no longer.</p>

<h3>
<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p><strong>Shuffly</strong> is an Android application designed for these very purposes and more. As you deftly tilt your phone across all three rotational axes, Shuffly allows you to control the Play toggle button, the Next and Previous buttons, and the Android volume slider. Don't use the default Android music player? Shuffly will effortlessly detect whatever's playing—even through Spotify and Pandora.</p>

<h3>
<a name="potential" class="anchor" href="#potential"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Potential</h3>

<p>Whether you're a distracted driver in need of free hands or a music enthusiast who's too engrossed to tediously open her lock screen, Shuffly has what it takes to fundamentally change the way you experience music.</p>

<h3>
<a name="try-it" class="anchor" href="#try-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Try It</h3>

<p>Go to skalon.com/shuffly/Shuffly.apk to download Shuffly. Open up the app, toggle the "Start" button, open up your favorite music player, and have a good time!</p>
